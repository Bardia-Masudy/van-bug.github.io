Affiliation: Assistant Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology/OVCARE, UBC Bio: Dr. Talhouk is an assistant professor in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia. She is also the director of data science and informatics at OVCARE, BC\u2019s ovarian and gynecological cancer research program. She completed her PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia in 2013 with a focus on computational statistics and machine learning. Since then, she has been working on developing and implementing predictive models to improve patient care in women\u2019s health and oncology. Her research focus also includes the ethics of data sharing and privacy in the era of digital health and AI modeling. Abstract: Endometrial cancer (EC) has increased by 2-3% per year since 2005, due in part to a global increase in obesity, a common risk factor. In this talk, I will motivate the need for early screening and prevention in EC using self-testing and minimally invasive approaches. I will describe the protocol of an upcoming feasibility study where we identify and recruit asymptomatic, menopausal women at high-risk for EC using a two-step screening approach. Participants will be directed to a tailored hormonal and lifestyle intervention. As part of this study, we will also evaluate whether DNA mutations and microbiome data can predict endometrial pathology.

He did his PhD in the lab of Tim Hughes at the University of Toronto, and was a postdoctoral fellow in Aviv Regev\u2019s lab at the Broad institute until the end of 2019, after which he moved to his current position at UBC. Abstract: In this talk, I will present two recent works from our lab based on high throughput gene expression measurements of random DNA. We measured the gene regulatory activities of over 100 million random promoter sequences in the model eukaryote yeast S. cerevisiae. We then used these data to train interpretable and deep learning models that relate DNA sequence to gene expression. The interpretable model captures the biochemical activities of the proteins (transcription factors) that regulate gene expression, and their interactions with chromatin from scratch, and revealed an unexpected prevalence of weak gene regulatory interactions. The deep learning (transformer) model enabled us to query the evolution of gene expression, and revealed an unexpectedly dynamic evolutionary space for promoter sequences while providing insight into the evolutionary past and future of promoter sequences. The \u201cBig Data\u201d we generated in these studies has proven to be exceptionally rich, and we hope it will serve as a standard dataset for machine learning for gene regulation.
