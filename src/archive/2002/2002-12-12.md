**Talk summary:**

The Genome Sciences Centre, has a committed focus to exploiting genomic

techologies to further our understanding of cancer. To achieve this goal,

we are using expression profiling techniques to understand expression

changes in early stage cancers. We are generating bioinformatic approaches

to rapidly analyse and derive biological inference from such data. We are

developing methodolgies to integrate data from other sources to aid in the

interpretation of gene expression changes, resolving the corrleative from

the causitive. We also intend to integrate experimental data from

Comparative Genomic Hybridization and Proteomic data.
