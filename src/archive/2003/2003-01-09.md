**Talk summary:**

We are developing web-accessible community databases to support research on two diseases: Huntington’s Disease (HD) and type 1 diabetes. The goal is to provide a convenient website where researchers working on these diseases can find information that will save them time, and make their research more productive. We are nearing the end of the requirements gathering phase for these projects and have begun initial implementation. This talk describes what we’ve learned about the requirements for these databases and will discuss our current thoughts on design and implementation.
