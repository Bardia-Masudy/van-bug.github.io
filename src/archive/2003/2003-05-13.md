# May - CIHR/MSFHR Bioinformatics Training Program Students

**Speaker**: CIHR/MSFHR Bioinformatics Training Program Students

The final VanBUG (Vancouver Bioinformatics User Group) of the year will

feature research presentations by the senior cohort of graduate students

in the CIHR/MSFHR Strategic Training Program in Bioinformatics. This

will take place Thursday, May 13 from 6 to 9pm in the Chan Auditorium at

the BC Research Institute for Children’s and Women’s Health.

The ninety minute presentation session will be followed by a

far-better-than-pizza catered reception, similar to last year’s Fifty

Years of DNA bash.
