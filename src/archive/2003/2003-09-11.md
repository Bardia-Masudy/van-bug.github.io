**Talk summary:**

Genome projects have facilitated the creation of a variety of high-throughput techniques for assaying genes, proteins, and their patterns of expression. While the laboratory protocols have matured, the challenge of effectively collecting, managing, and analyzing the data remains. Our group has constructed a sophisticated analysis pipeline built on a MIAME-supportive database and including a number of freely-available, open source java tools that that allow bench scientists to effectively capture experimental information and analyze their results. This presentation will focus on these tools and will demonstrate some of their capabilities.
