**Talk Summary:**

How can we better combat infectious disease microbes? The Brinkman laboratory has developed bioinformatic approaches to address this that involve analyses of microbe virulence factors, cell surface proteins, and host gene expression responses to infection. Unexpected insights gained from such analyses include clues about the nature of cellular networks. Selected methods will be presented which illustrate bioinformatics pitfalls to be avoided by any bioinformatics researcher analyzing genomes from microbes to mammals.
