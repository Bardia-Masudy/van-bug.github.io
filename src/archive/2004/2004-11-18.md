**Abstract:**

The BioMOBY project was established as a community-driven open source effort to find a simple, extensible solution to the problem of interoperability between bioinformatics data and analytical resources. Now a Genome Canada funded project, it has been two years since the first prototypes were made public, and one year since a stable API, supporting code, and messaging layer standards were released. Public BioMOBY services (MOBY-S) are currently being provided by more than 20 independent institutions worldwide, and the platform has been adopted by several high-profile international consortia. With the collaboration of the UK myGrid consortium, a client application is now available that is capable of discovering and executing MOBY services singly, or in manually or automatically constructed pipelines. Taverna thus represents the first fully-featured MOBY client program, and its success indicates that the spread of MOBY will now begin to hasten.

Given these events, and given the parallel development of competing technologies such as myGrid, it is now appropriate to step back and evaluate what BioMOBY does, how it does it, what are the successes and failures in the BioMOBY approach, and what direction it should take over the next three years. Though the system will be demoed at this presentaiton, the talk will focus primarily on the theoretical aspects of web service interoperability, and explore the nature of the interoperability and integration problems in the context of the BioMOBY solution. Finally, a new related initiative – CardioSHARE – will be briefly discussed to showcase the powerful technologies that can be built when interoperability frameworks are finally in place.
