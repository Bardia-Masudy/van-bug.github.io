**Abstract:**

This talk will present a probabilistic approach to investigating three problems related to biological networks:

the de novo inference of networks, the purification of existing networks and the use of these networks as predictors. Probabilistic models of biological networks are an important element of so-called “integrative bioinformatics” and allow us to test hypotheses by combining many heterogeneous types of information within a coherent statistical framework. A nice property of this framework is that we can assign a “belief” to each element of the putative network. We will show how our model is used in three different domains: the ER Associated Degradation pathway (ERAD), the TGF-beta pathway, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulation.
