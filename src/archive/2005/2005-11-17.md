**Abstract:**

Comparative biologists, whether focussing on genomics, physiology or ecology, now use phylogeny as a central interpretive framework. The open source Mesquite Project (mesquiteproject.org) provides analytical tools for such phylogenetic interpetation. Its modularity gives it flexibility and a great diversity of possible analyses, but at the same time presents to developers challenges in designing a usable interface.
