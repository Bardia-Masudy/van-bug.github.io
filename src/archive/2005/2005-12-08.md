**Abstract:**

This talk will describe some of our combined experimental and computational methods for determining the specificity of DNA-binding proteins and for discovering regulatory sites in genomic DNA sequences. It will cover aspects of the algorithms we have developed and the types of experiments we employ to test the predictions and refine the models.
