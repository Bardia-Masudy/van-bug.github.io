**Abstract:**

Predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences has been challenging within physics-based modeling because of the size and difficulty of this global optimization problem. However, many real proteins fold very quickly (microseconds). We show here how insights from physical protein folding can be used to speed up computational protein structure prediction.
