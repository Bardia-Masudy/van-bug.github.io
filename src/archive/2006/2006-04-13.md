**Abstract:**

The BioPerl toolkit has become an invaluable tool for bioinformatics data processing. The project, first started in 1995, has grown and matured over the years and now serves as key components in many bioinformatics tools from simple data parsing scripts in a lab to the Generic Genome Browser. The toolkit provides support for analyses from population genetics to molecular evolution, BLAST parsing to accessing raw sequence traces, querying GenBank to relational databases for sequences and annotations. The project is open source which has allowed many different ideas to be integrated and for community ownership of the software. I’ll speak to the experience of developing open source software with developer and user groups of many different experience levels.
