| **Abstract:**
The advent of large, multi-laboratory proteomics experiments has led to a near crisis in the exchange of information describing both the results of these experiments and the details of the experiments themselves. The lecture will critically discuss the informatics projects underway to standardize the communication of this information and give examples of how the application of bioinformatics at the level of laboratory experimentation is changing the way that proteomics is done. <http://www.thegpm.org>
