**Abstract:**

Characterizing the network of physical and functional interactions on the genome scale has become a major focus of research in Biology. Mapping out these networks is a first important step towards gaining understanding of how individual cellular components (proteins genes, small molecules) cooperate to yield the complex cellular processes that underlie the behaviour of living cells. Examples from our own work will be used to discuss issues and illustrate approaches in analyzing networks of small molecule metabolism, and in deriving meaningful functional modules in networks of physically interacting proteins.
