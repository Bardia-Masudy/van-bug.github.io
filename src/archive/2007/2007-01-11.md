**Abstract:**

Computational methods for predicting functional rather than thermodynamic

RNA structures have recently attracted increased interest. These methods

are not only indispensable for elucidating the regulatory roles of known

RNA transcripts, but also for predicting RNA genes. Devising them has been

notoriously difficult because a number of computational challenges have to

be overcome in order to make the best use of the available data and to

predict high-quality RNA structures that may also contain pseudo-knots.

In this talk, I will introduce a novel theoretical framework that allows

us to detect functional RNA structure including pseudo-knots in a

comparative way and that overcomes the conceptual limitations of the

current RNA structure prediction methods.
