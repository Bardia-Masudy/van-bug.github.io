**Abstract:**

Many functional RNA genes and regulatory motifs conserve not only

their sequence but also a base-paired secondary structure, so RNA

homology searches should take both sequence and structure into

account. “Stochastic context-free grammars” (SCFGs) provide a

well-grounded, fully probabilistic framework in which to construct RNA

structure/sequence analysis algorithms, including RNA homology search

algorithms in addition to other applications such as RNA genefinding.

I will discuss recent advances in our Infernal profile SCFG software

for RNA homology search, including a new probabilistic method called

QDB (query-dependent banding) for accelerating Infernal about

five-fold. I will also discuss the status of the growing Rfam database

of structural RNA alignments.
