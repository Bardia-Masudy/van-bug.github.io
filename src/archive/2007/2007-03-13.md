**Abstract:**

The National Center for Biomedical Ontology is developing tools and methods for assimilating, archiving, and accessing machine processable representations of biomedical domain objects, processes, and relations. These tools will assist in the management, integration, visualization, analysis, and interpretation of the huge, distributed data sets that are now the hallmark of biomedical research. The center involves the participation of scientific groups from a number of institutions including Stanford University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the University of California at San Francisco, Mayo Clinic, and the University of Victoria. In this talk, I will present several research problems being addressed by the team at the University of Victoria. Broadly, our goal is to develop visual interfaces to assist in ontology annotation, mapping and management of a virtual library of Open Biomedical Ontologies and a Web-based BioPortal. I will demonstrate visualization tools for browsing ontologies, mapping ontologies and browsing sets of clinical trials. As this talk reports work in progress at the National Center for Biomedical Ontology, I welcome

discussion and suggestions on the technology being developed by the center.
