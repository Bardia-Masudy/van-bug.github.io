**Description:**

The first human genome sequence was published in April 2003. Since that

time, scientists from many disciplines have begun to develop

applications for predicting how medical treatments will affect individuals.

Internationally-renowned Dr. Eric Green, of the National Human Genome

Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,

Maryland, will discuss his ongoing research. His work focuses on

unraveling the complexities of genome function through large-scale

comparative genomics, and seeks to understand the genetic basis for

certain human diseases. To date, his group has identified genes

associated with hereditary deafness, vascular disease, cancer, and

neurological disease.

About the speaker

Reporting directly to Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Eric Green is the

Scientific Director of the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) at the

National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The DIR is a focal

point at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for genome research and

maintains core facilities that serve as a resource for the entire NIH

intramural research community. In addition, Dr. Green serves as Chief of

the NHGRI Genome Technology Branch (since 1996) and Director of the NIH

Intramural Sequencing Center (since 1997).

Dr. Green received his B.S. degree in Bacteriology from the University

of Wisconsin-Madison in 1981, and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from

Washington University in 1987. Since the early 1990s, Dr. Greenâ€™s

research program has been at the forefront of efforts to map, sequence,

and understand eukaryotic genomes. His work includes significant,

start-to-finish involvement in the Human Genome Project.
