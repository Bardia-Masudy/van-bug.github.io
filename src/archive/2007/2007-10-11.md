**Abstract:**

Understanding the mechanisms underlying life and causes of

most diseases demands a global view and understanding of genes in the

entire genome. The accomplishment of the Human Genome Projects and

success of many subsequent advances in genomics have made it possible to

examine the expression and function of many genes simultaneously.

However, the availability of these data sets and resources has not

provided immediate insight into the mechanisms underlying our lives, nor

has it provided cures to numerous devastating diseases. My laboratory is

interested in developing bioinformatics and genomics data mining

programs and in applying these programs in identifying novel genes,

structural variations, and regulatory mechanisms. The ultimate goal is

to understand, using combined computational and experimental approaches,

gene structure, function, and regulation in health and disease

conditions. Such understanding will eventually lead to the practice of

personalized medicine.
