**Abstract:**

In the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell, DNA is wrapped into a complex,

dynamic molecular structure known as chromatin. Over the past

several years, we have collaborated with experimental labs to create

and validate a series of computational models of chromatin in human

and yeast. In this talk, I will describe three models, which (1) predict

local chromatin organization from sequence, (2) delineate larger-scale

chromatin domains from high-throughput cleavage data, and (3)

identify protein-binding footprints on a genomewide scale.
