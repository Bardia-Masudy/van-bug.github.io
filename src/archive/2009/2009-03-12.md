**Abstract:**

The explosion of functional genomics data, including microarray,

proteomics, and high-throughput genetic studies, has the promise of a

systems-level view of protein function, interactions, and regulation.

In the future, such systems-level understanding of biology can pave

the way for predictive physiological models and molecular medicine.

However, these data are noisy, computationally diverse, and

biologically heterogeneous. I will discuss our recent work in

developing robust methods for integrated analysis of these data with

the goal of enabling exploration and discovery of novel biology, and

in addressing the disconnect between computation and experiments

through an integrative computational-experimental framework for

function discovery. We applied these methods to data from human and

model organisms, identifying and experimentally validating previously

unknown protein functions, including several new players in

macroautophagy in human fibroblasts and over 100 new mitochondrial

organization and biogenesis proteins in yeast.
