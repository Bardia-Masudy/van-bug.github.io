    **Abstract:**
    
    Visual Analytics is the study of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. It is an outgrowth of Information Visualization and encompasses expertise from fields such as Statistics, Cognitive Psychology, Social Science, Computer Science, Graphic Design, and Information Design. This talk will give a brief overview of the field of Visual Analytics, and will lead to the introduction of a Visual Analytics system I have developed called IMAS that is aimed at the analysis and visualization of microbial DNA.
