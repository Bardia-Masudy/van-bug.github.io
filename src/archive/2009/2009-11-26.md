    **Abstract:**
    
    The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has propelled the field of cancer
    
    genomics forward such that it is now cost-effective to interrogate entire genomes or
    
    transcriptomes of clinical tumor samples for the presence of somatic mutations: often
    
    the key driver genomic alterations in tumorigenesis. Since the number of data points
    
    produced by NGS experiments is in the billions, variant discovery is necessarily a
    
    computational exercise. I will describe the development of novel computational methods
    
    for the discovery of mutations from NGS, based on probabilistic models. I will present
    
    results of applying these approaches in two recent studies in ovarian and breast cancer:
    
    namely the discovery of a novel recurrent and defining mutation in the FOXL2 gene in
    
    granulosa cell tumours of the ovary and the first description of mutational evolution of a
    
    breast cancer seen at nucleotide resolution.
