    **Abstract:**
    
    Structural variation of the genome is an important aspect in our understanding of
    
    human disease and evolution. Accurately characterizing such variation an unmet
    
    challenge of both bioinformatics and genomics. I will focus on the genome-wide
    
    discovery, analysis and distribution of copy-number variants (CNV) and inversion
    
    polymorphisms within human and great ape species. I will present methods to
    
    accurately resolve the copy, content and structure of these regions based on
    
    traditional and next-generation sequence datasets. I will discuss our efforts to
    
    characterize regions of the genome that are prone to recurrent deletion, duplication
    
    and inversion and provide examples of their importance as recurrent and de novo
    
    sources of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disease.
