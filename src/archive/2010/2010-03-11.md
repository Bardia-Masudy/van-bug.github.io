    **Abstract:**
    
    
    I will discuss recent applications of the Rosetta protein structure prediction and
    
    design platform to understanding genomes. There are two main ways we can use
    
    structural bioinformatics to aid in the building of genome wide models: 1) providing
    
    predictions about the structure, function and interaction of proteins, and 2) designing
    
    new molecules that can be used as tools to specifically perturb individual functions
    
    and interactions. In this talk I will primarily focus on the design of new tools. I will
    
    describe our recent efforts to accurately predict temperature sensitive mutations that
    
    can be used to investigate the effects of essential genes. I will also describe our
    
    efforts to include non-cannonical amino acids and non-canonical backbone structures
    
    (such as N-branched side chains, peptoids) in the design of peptidomimetics that
    
    target specific protein-interactions. All protocols for prediction and design are
    
    seamlessly integrated into the Rosetta package and available at the
    
    Rosetta-commons: http://www.rosettacommons.org/
