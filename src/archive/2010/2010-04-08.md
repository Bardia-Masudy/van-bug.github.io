    **Abstract:**
    
    Over one-third of all proteins in a eukaryotic cell contain regions that
    
    are intrinsically disordered. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
    
    lack a unique 3-dimensional structure, either entirely or in parts, when
    
    alone in solution. Alterations of the endogenous levels of IDPs have
    
    been associated with severe pathological conditions such as
    
    neurodegeneration and cancer. I will discuss strategies that eukaryotic
    
    cells have developed to minimize the potentially harmful effects of IDPs.
