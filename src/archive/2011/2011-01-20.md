**Abstract:**

With the number of sequenced vertebrate genomes rapidly growing, the exciting prospect of being able to accurately infer ancestral genomes becomes within reach. In this presentation, I will discuss how ancestral DNA sequences can be inferred and how they can be then used to help addressing some key questions in genomics. Reconstructing ancestral sequences poses a number of algorithmic challenges. I will first describe some of our work on aligning orthologous sequence and inferring ancestral sequences, focusing on the accurate identification of insertions and deletions. Next, I will discuss how one can take advantage of the availability of inferred ancestral sequences to help at three important tasks: (i) identify non-coding sites under selection in the human genome; (ii) improve the detection of transcription factor binding sites; and (iii) determine the target gene(s) of long-range enhancers. Evolution has been conducting site-specific functionality assays for hundreds of millions of years. The ability to decipher the results of these experiments has and will continue to provide us with a wealth of information about our genome and the impact of mutations.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion

of both science and career paths. This takes place 4:30-5:30pm in either

the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
