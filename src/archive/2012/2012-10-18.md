**Talk Title:** A Biostatistician’s Take on Biomarkers

**Date/Time:**

Thursday, October 18th, 2012, 6:00 pm

**Affiliation:** Senior Scientist, Statistician, Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services (CDPACS), BC Centre for Disease Control

**URL:** [Robert Balshaw](http://www.proofcentre.ca/about/our-team/management-team/dr-robert-balshaw-statistical-lead/)

**Abstract:**

The traditional training of a biostatistician ill prepares one to encounter the enormous datasets and science-fiction technologies that arise during the search for biomarkers. In my talk I will describe a few of the interesting projects I have had the good luck work on over the last few years and how biomarkers have become recurring theme in my work. Along the way, I will discuss some of the ways that Bioinformatics and Biostatistics may cross-pollinate with one another in the search for and validation of new biomarkers.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 4:30-5:30pm in either the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
