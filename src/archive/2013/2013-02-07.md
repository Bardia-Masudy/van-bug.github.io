**Talk Title:** Biological Models with Combinatorial Spaces

**Date/Time:**

Thursday, February 7th, 2013, 6:00 pm

**Affiliation:** Postdoctoral Researcher at University of British Columbia

**URL:** [Bonnie Kirkpatrick](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bbkirk/)

**Abstract:**

Probabilistic models are common in biology. Many of the successful models have been readily tractable, leaving calculations on models with a combinatorial-sized state space as an open problem. This talk examines two kinds of models with combinatorial state spaces: continuous-time and discrete-time Markov chains. These models are applied to two problems: RNA folding pathways and family genetics. While the applications are disparate topics in biology, they are related via their models, the statistical quantities of interest, and in some cases the computational techniques used to calculate those quantities.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 4:30-5:30pm in either the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
