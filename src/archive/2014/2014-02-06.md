### PIMS Distinguished Speaker

**Talk Title:** Light-Based Systems Biology & Next, Next Gen Sequencing

    **Date/Time:**
    
    Thursday, February 6, 2014, 6:00pm

**Affiliation:** Director & Tschira Chair of Systems Biology, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics

**URL:** [Gene Myers](http://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/research-groups/gene-myers.html)

**Abstract:**

We are now at a time when we can systematically alter animals genetically so that any given protein or its expression can be observed in a targeted set of cells. Combined with new modalities of light microscopy, this allows us to observe molecular mechanisms within the cell, observe the developmental trajectory of growing organs, and to map the cellular anatomy of organisms and organs such as a fly brain. Several brief examples from our work will be presented: on the biophysics of cell division, on *C.elegans* lineage tracking, and on the reconstruction of every neuron in a fly brain. To end, we give a vision of microscopes and software that we hope will lead to an understanding of how complex tissues and shapes develop in cellular terms.

With the arrival of long-read sequencing instruments, the potential to produce reference quality reconstructions of novel genomes is once again a possibility. We briefly discuss the nature of the reconstruction problem in this context and our new work on the assembly of such data sets.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 4:30-5:30pm in either the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
