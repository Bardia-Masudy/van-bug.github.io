**Bio:**

David Clarke has Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in kinesiology (Laurentian, Waterloo) and a Ph.D. in chemical and biological engineering (University of Colorado at Boulder). He conducted postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Douglas Lauffenburger (Biological Engineering, MIT) in collaboration with scientists at the US Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine. He joined the Department of Biomedical Physiology and Kinesiology at Simon Fraser University in September 2013 where he runs a research program devoted to the quantitative analysis of exercise stress.

**Abstract:**

Receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways promote cellular homeostasis by sensing local environmental conditions, integrating this information, and determining the subsequent adaptations. Mutations within these pathways lead to diseases such as cancer, such that it is of biomedical importance to understand and predict their behaviours. Predicting their behaviour is challenging because of their complexity, which stems from the number of components and their interconnections into a network. In this talk, I will describe methods used to address this complexity, emphasizing different modeling algorithms and proteomics and imaging data, which are used to investigate signaling downstream of inflammation and physiological stressors. In doing so, my talk will highlight the statistical and mechanistic modeling side of bioinformatics.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 4:30-5:30pm in either the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
