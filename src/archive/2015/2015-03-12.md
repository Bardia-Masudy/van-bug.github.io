**Bio:**

C. Titus Brown is an Associate Professor in Population Health and Reproduction at UC Davis, where his lab works on developing novel data analysis approaches and software for sequencing data. Among several other projects, his lab develops the khmer software at <http:/github.com/ged-lab/khmer/>. He blogs at <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/>

**Abstract:**

Practically efficient and effective software for analyzing large volumes of short-read sequencing data is important for biology, and our driving vision for khmer has been to provide a general solution for scaling and improving de novo assembly. We have begun to explore ways of using khmer to work more generally with read and reference graphs, and I’ll talk about some of the interesting applications that we are envisioning in the future.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 4:30-5:30pm in either the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
