**Abstract:**

Targeted quantitative proteomics using multiple/selected/parallel reaction monitoring (MRM, SRM, PRM) is already being applied by many researchers in biology, biochemistry, and clinical research laboratories because these methods allow rapid and precise quantitation of proteins in complex biological samples. Multiplexed MRM/PRM experiments are manageable manually for tens of target proteins in tens of samples, but scaling-up to hundreds of targets in thousands of samples is challenging. As a result, the planning, data analysis, and interpretation of the results from these experiments are all lengthy processes, usually requiring expertise in bioinformatics and proteomics. The talk will deal with few challenges in designing and running targeted experiments, and will focus on recent bioinformatic developments that helped accelerating the design and reducing human error by integrating information from online resources, using reactive programming, and implementing scientific workflows

**Bio:**

Yassene Mohammed is leading the bioinformatics activities at the University of Victoria Proteomics Centre, Victoria, Canada, and he is an assistant professor in bioinformatics at the Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. Yassene received his PhD in Medical Informatics from the University of Göttingen, Germany. His research interests are targeted and bottom-up proteomics, proteomics analysis of model systems, data and information integration, automated data processing, data protection and data security, and eScience.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 5:00-5:45pm in either the Boardroom or Lunchroom on the ground floor of the BCCRC
