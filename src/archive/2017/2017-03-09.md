**Abstract:**

The advent of high throughput, droplet based systems for assaying transcriptomes at the single cell resolution has revolutionized our approach to studying complex biological systems. We recently described a fully-integrated, droplet based approach, the ChromiumTM single cell system, that enables 3’ mRNA digital counting of up to millions of single cells. High efficiency cell capture coupled with a low doublet rate (<1% per 1000 cells) facilitates the profiling of precious and rare cell populations. We have also developed an open source analysis pipeline, Cell RangerTM, that is optimized for efficient processing of sequence data. Recently, we released an interactive analysis and visualization tool call Cell LoupeTM.

In this talk, I will demonstrate the power of the ChromiumTM single cell system to dissect heterogeneous populations through the analysis of ~1.3 million brain cells from cortex, hippocampus and ventricular zones of 2 E18 mice. In addition, I will illustrate the power of this system to track the progression of diseases through comparative analysis of AML patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Lastly, I will introduce an upcoming addition to the system to characterize paired T cell receptor alpha and beta chains in 10s of 1000s of T cells.

**Bio:**

Grace Zheng is a computational biologist with over 10 years of experience in genomics, RNA, and stem cell research. She received her PhD in Computational and Systems Biology from MIT and her postdoctoral training at Stanford University School of Medicine. She is currently a senior scientist at 10X Genomics, leading projects on single cell RNA-seq and linked-read technology to detect structural variants.

**Please note:**

Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths. This takes place 5:00-5:45pm.
