**Bio:**

Dr. Gabriela Cohen Freue has completed her Ph.D in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Maryland at Collage Park and postdoctoral studies in Biostatistics through her participation in the Biomarkers in Transplantation (BiT) initiative, hosted by the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. She then joined PROOF Centre of Excellence where she led the statistical analysis of proteomics data. She is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia and a Canada Research Chair-II in Statistical Proteomics. Her research interests are in robust estimation and regularization of linear models with applications to Statistical Genomics and Proteomics.

**Abstract:**

Prediction of protein levels from mRNA levels has long been fraught with unreliability and lack of precision. However, it has been recently claimed that using estimated gene-specific translation rates together with mRNA levels accurately predicts protein levels in any given tissue, reporting large correlations between predictions and measurements across genes (e.g., [1-2]). We show that these correlations greatly overestimate the accuracy of per-gene predictions [3]. Using simple and standard statistical evaluation methods, we demonstrate that the gene-specific protein prediction cannot be evaluated across genes. We show alternative appropriate approaches to evaluate per-gene prediction methods of protein from mRNA levels.
