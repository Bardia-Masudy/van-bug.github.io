**Affiliation:** Assistant Professor, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia

**Bio:**

Dr. Steif recently joined the Department of Medical Genetics and BC Cancer Research Institute as an Assistant Professor. Previously, she held a Schmidt Science Fellowship and Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge. She completed her postdoctoral training with Dr. John Marioni at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and European Bioinformatics Institute. Prior to this, she obtained her PhD at UBC under the supervision of Dr. Sohrab Shah and Dr. Sam Aparicio. Her research focused on breast cancer susceptibility and tumour evolution, and she co-led the development of new methods for profiling single cell genomes at scale.

**Abstract:**

Tumours are heterogeneous populations of cells whose evolution in response to selective pressures underpins treatment resistance and metastatic progression. This talk will focus on recent developments in experimental and analytical methods for single cell genomics. We will discuss direct library preparation (DLP), a high throughput tagmentation-based approach for generating single cell whole genome sequencing libraries without pre-amplification. By using fragment coordinates as unique molecular identifiers, DLP offers improved coverage uniformity. This enables high-resolution copy number inference at the single cell level and single nucleotide variant calling at the clone or population level. Finally, we will present a new probabilistic model that enables true absolute aneuploidy inference from single cell genomes, addressing a long-standing challenge in cancer informatics and revealing previously undetected sub-populations in complex breast and ovarian tumours.
