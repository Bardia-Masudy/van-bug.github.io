**Judges:**

**Presentation rules:**

- Presentations were done remotely and 100% live.

- Presentation content should be targeted towards a lay audience.

- Speakers were be introduced by VanBUG via a slide that contains the speaker information (name, affiliation, talk title, etc.). This will not count against the speaker’s presentation time; we will read the speaker introductory slide and begin the presentation timer upon transition to the speaker’s content.

- Speakers were only be able to present **ONE** slide. The slide must contain static content (e.g. no videos/recordings). Font size minimum 12 pt (this is not a poster).

- Speakers presented back-to-back.

- The question and answer period did not occur until after awards have been announced to avoid indirectly giving speakers addition time to clarify their research.

- Presentations were judged by a VanBUG panel of bioinformatics practitioners on (1) overall quality and (2) whether the speaker was able to convey the aims, importance, and impact of their research.

- The “Viewer’s Choice” award was determined via an anonymous audience poll.

**Speaker qualifications**

The Speaker had to be either:

(i) still enrolled in a graduate program in BC, or

(ii) still enrolled in an undergraduate program in BC, or

(iii) has defended their thesis no earlier than September 2021 from a BC college/university.
