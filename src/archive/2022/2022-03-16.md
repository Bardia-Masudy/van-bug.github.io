**Bio:**

Dr. Talhouk is an assistant professor in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia. She is also the director of data science and informatics at OVCARE, BC’s ovarian and gynecological cancer research program. She completed her PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia in 2013 with a focus on computational statistics and machine learning. Since then, she has been working on developing and implementing predictive models to improve patient care in women’s health and oncology. Her research focus also includes the ethics of data sharing and privacy in the era of digital health and AI modeling.

**Abstract:**

Endometrial cancer (EC) has increased by 2-3% per year since 2005, due in part to a global increase in obesity, a common risk factor. In this talk, I will motivate the need for early screening and prevention in EC using self-testing and minimally invasive approaches. I will describe the protocol of an upcoming feasibility study where we identify and recruit asymptomatic, menopausal women at high-risk for EC using a two-step screening approach. Participants will be directed to a tailored hormonal and lifestyle intervention. As part of this study, we will also evaluate whether DNA mutations and microbiome data can predict endometrial pathology.
