# Lay-Term Talks Competition 2023

VanBUG is hosting a lay-terms talks competition where students are given the opportunity to share their work in short, 3 minute presentations! These presentations can be on any research the speaker has participated in (e.g. directed studies, internships, thesis work, research assistants) but must be convey in terminology that is accessible to the general public. The intent is to show your ability to communicate research in an accessible, non-expert friendly manner to friends, family, and peers. The means in which you communicate is open to creativity! That is, participants are welcome to go beyond their words with creative visual aids!

Award certificates and gift cards ($) will be provided to contest winners. Competition placements (1st, 2nd, 3rd) will be determined by a panel of judges with expertise in science communication, with the exception of the "Viewer's Choice" award which will be determined by the audience.

Participation and attendance is FREE but registration is required.

The competition will be followed by a social where food and refreshments are provided.
