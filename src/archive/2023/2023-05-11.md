## Synopsis

VanBUG is hosting a competition for post-secondary students to present their scientific research in lay terms within 3 minutes! Each presentation should be about a student's research project (e.g. directed studies, internship, thesis work, etc.) related to computer or biological sciences. Students should feel free to present regardless of their project's scope or duration — the intent of this competition is to promote science communication in a manner accessible to the general public. We welcome participants to be creative and go beyond just words with their visual aids! 

Winners will receive award certificates and gift cards:

- 1st Place: $150
- 2nd Place: $90
- 3rd Place: $45
- Viewer's Choice: $45
