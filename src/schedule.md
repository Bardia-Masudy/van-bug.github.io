    VanBUG is hosting a **Career Panel** to give current and future students an opportunity to learn and explore bioinformatics career paths from experienced representatives of the bioinformatics community. This is also a unique opportunity to hear panelists’ first hand experiences working in the field before and during the pandemic and their thoughts on the future of working in bioinformatics.
    The event will include a one-hour moderated (3-5 person) panel discussion that will be followed by networking over food and refreshments. Panelists from industry, academia, and government will be present. _More details to come._
